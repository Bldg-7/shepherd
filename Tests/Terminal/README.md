# Terminal focus-frame regression

```sh
python3 Tests/Terminal/run-frame-tests.py --output /tmp/shepherd-frame-FRESH \
  --swiftterm-products /path/to/DerivedData/Build/Products/Debug
```

Uses the actual `TerminalPaneFrame`, `TerminalHostView` and pinned SwiftTerm
object/module from an existing build. No package download/plugin approval.

The test creates one owned, never-shown AppKit window and one owned kernel PTY
pair (`openpty`), with CLOEXEC descriptors and explicit closure. It never starts a
shell, attaches Herdr, accesses SSH/Keychain, activates a window, or sends user GUI
input. Real `TerminalViewDelegate.sizeChanged` requests are mirrored to this owned
PTY via `TIOCSWINSZ` and verified with `TIOCGWINSZ`.

At 800×480, 520×330 and 1040×600 points:
- The native terminal is inset 3pt on every edge, outside the 2pt stroke band.
- Actual native row/column counts and resize callback/kernel-PTY dimensions agree.
- Focus changes retain the same native view, bounds, grid and resize count.
- The bottom-left first cell of owned status text remains intact.

This checks real SwiftTerm/AppKit geometry and kernel PTY size delivery. It is not
interactive acceptance of the user's installed app or a live Herdr/SSH session.
The production session resize path is unchanged; its existing factory/lifecycle
regressions are run separately. File-link hit testing remains in native terminal
coordinates, not in the outer gutter's coordinates.
